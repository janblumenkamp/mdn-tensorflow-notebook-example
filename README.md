# MDN on Tensorflow Example Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with an example of a Mixture Density Network (MDN) using Tensorflow. It accompanies [our blog-post](https://engineering.taboola.com/predicting-probability-distributions/) about MDNs.

Adapted by janblumenkamp to use Keras and TensorFlow 2.0
